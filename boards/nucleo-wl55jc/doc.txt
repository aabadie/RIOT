@brief       Support for the STM32 Nucleo-WL55JC

## Flashing the device

The ST Nucleo-WL55JC board includes an on-board ST-LINK V2 programmer. The
easiest way to program the board is to use OpenOCD. Once you have installed
OpenOCD (look [here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/OpenOCD) for
installation instructions), you can flash the board simply by typing

```
make BOARD=nucleo-wl55jc flash
```
and debug via GDB by simply typing
```
make BOARD=nucleo-wl55jc debug
```


## Supported Toolchains

For using the ST Nucleo-L476RG board we strongly recommend the usage of the
[GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded)
toolchain.
